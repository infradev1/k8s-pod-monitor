# Kubernetes Pod Monitor CLI

A lightweight Go-based CLI tool that watches all pods in a Kubernetes cluster and logs any containers that have restarted.
If --namespace=kube-system, it monitors the health of the control plane static pods.

Ideal for DevOps engineers, SREs, or platform teams who want real-time visibility into pod health for troubleshooting or automation.
